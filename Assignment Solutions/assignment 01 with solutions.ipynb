    "#### Van Der Pol:\n",
    "\n",
    "This system makes any initial condition apart from the equilibrium in [0, 0] converge towards a shared cyclical trajectory called a limit cycle.\n",
    "That would mean any point infinitely close to the equilibrium would have to diverge from it in order to reach the limit cycle. It is then easy to deduce that this equilibrium is unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mass-spring-damper:\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is modelled after a real world mechanical system where energy is lost over time. The equilibrium in [0, 0] is therefore stable as the lowest energetic state of the system. We can also conclude that it is asymptotically stable, as a small nudge from the equilibrium would result in the state returning to [0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "If we removed any dampening in the system, any oscillation would last indefinitely. This would not move the equilibrium, but it would make the stability of it marginally stable instead of asymptotically stable. This is because any small nudge from [0, 0] would not lead to divergence from the centerpoint, but we would also not see the state return back to [0, 0] ever.\n",
    "Adding back the dampening, but removing the spring, we now have a system discribing a block sliding along the floor (basically). We can now see that in order for the block to lie still, x2 must be 0, but x1 can be whatever as it does not matter where the block is for it to lie still. Such a system would yield infinite equilibria along the x1 axis. All of these equilibria would then only be marginally stable, as if you were to nudge the block along the x1-axis, it would happily just stay wherever you put it. Therefore not returning, therefore not granting asymptotical stability to any of the equilibria.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lotka-volterra:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, we see sustained oscillations around a focus point in x'2 = [a/b, c/d]. These cycles are not to be confused with limit cycles, as there is no convergence towards a single cycle or set of cycles. While the van-der-pol oscillator had an unstable focus, we dont' see the same here. Were you to nudge the system away from x'2, it would not diverge, but rather stay very close to x'2 and oscillate around there forever. I'm sure you're getting where we're going with this. x'2 is marginally stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "That was not the only equilibrium we found in this system. As for x'1 = [0, 0], we know that any amount of predators without prey will go extinct. We also know that any amount of prey will reproduce exponentially without the presence of predators. Intuition would you lead you to think this yields a sort of half-stability since the equilibrium seems to inherit properties of both a stable and unstable point.\n",
    "This thought must be challenged, and the equilibrium can be thought of as balancing on a tight rope. Were you to only move straight forward, the ground is effectively flat and you can't possibly fall off. But were you to move any other direction, you don't make it far before you walk off. Stability is therefore the absolute absence of instability. With this in mind, we conclude that x'1 = [0, 0] is unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "Were you given the task of keeping a ball inside a bowl, you'd have an easy time. The ball rests in the middle of the bowl, and any other point in the bowl takes the ball to the middle. Now, were you cut a slice in the bowl going from the edge to the center, you'd still have the bowl, and if the ball inside it is big enough, you have nothing to worry about. However, given the slice through the bowl is infinitely thin and the ball is infinitely small, the task of keeping the ball inside the bowl gets almost impossible. This analogy can be a bit weird, but it helps develop the understanding that if any trajectory from an equilibrium diverges from it, then the equilibrium is unstable. Any nudge in any direction from the equilibrium must have the state come back in order to deem the point stable to begin with.\n"
